\section{Profile and Objectives}
\small I’m a trustful, goal-oriented, detail-focused professional with experience in both research and 
software engineering (also in both academic and non-academic environments), particularly in the fields of 
machine learning, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems. As a Research Engineer, I love 
exploring and implementing with cutting-edge technologies, particularly in AI/ML, to tackle complex 
challenges and foster innovation. As a Software Engineer, I can design, develop, and ensure the maintainability 
of robust and scalable big data applications, whether on-prem or cloud, always prioritizing high availability, 
scalability, performance, and reliability. I am adaptable, capable of taking initiative and leading efforts 
with a strategic approach when needed, or collaborating as a communicative, supportive, and empathetic team 
player to achieve shared goals. I thrive in open, dynamic, and multidisciplinary environments, integrating 
visionary and practical insights to deliver impactful results while empowering others and fostering collaboration.

2) Overall increases of 5\% and 4\% in precision and recall for Creative Works \\
}

\cventry{}{\small YKG}{Entity Reconciliation Pipeline}{2023}{\textbf{Roles}: Machine Learning/AI Expert, MLOps}{
Developed an automated pipeline for training entity reconciliation models for YK, from data curation to inference testing \\
\textbf{Goal/Achievement} Devise a solution to reduce the current number of models maintained in production from \~30 heterogeneous (heuristic-based, SVMs, Tree-based...) to just 4, which encompass the main 4 meta-entity types in YK \\
}

\cventry{Jun--Dec 2022}{\large Principal Research Engineer}{Yahoo Mail}{}{Sunnyvale}{}

\cventry{}{\small Science @ Mail}{Kamino Project - mail classification system}{2022}{\textbf{Roles}: Machine Learning/AI Expert}{
\textbf{Goal} Update the old production models with a new breed of deep learning based small distilled models suitable for running at scale. The models were classifying the incoming mail based on a new multilabel taxonomy created specifically for new use-cases required by the mail team.
\textbf{Approach}
I built a deep learning based pipeline with Hugging Face to train/evaluate deep learning models performing knowledge distillation following the Teacher/Student approach. Starting first from limited human-labeled training data, we built a large/complex, more accurate model; then we used a large amount of teacher-labeled data to train lightweight student models for suitable for deployment. Produce two kinds of models: 1) online student models; faster but less accurate suitable for real-time classification tasks. 2) offline student model; slower but include richer information that provides better accuracy results. \\
\textbf{Achievements} \\
The resulting student models for an expanded taxonomy, more than doubling the number of deployable categories in the taxonomy while improving performance on existing categories in production by 3.1-5.9\%
}

\cventry{Apr--Sep 2022}{\large Principal Research Engineer}{Digital Transformation Office @ Yahoo}{}{Sunnyvale}{}

\cventry{}{\small AI/ML Working Group}{AI/ML future strategy definition in the cloud}{}{\textbf{Roles}: ML/AI Expert, Strategy}{
Yahoo infrastructure was going to transition from its own datacenters and resources to work fully in the cloud. Scientist and Research Engineers training, running, and serving ML/DL models needed a modern set of tools to share datasets, models and reproducible experiments with colleagues, rapidly experiment with, and iterate on new models, and finally, publish and deploy them easily into pre-production/production environments. \\
\textbf{Goal} The Model Development group in particular had as mission to determine the requirements, standards, tools, and frameworks to enable ML/DL applications at scale across the company. \\
\textbf{Achievements} \\
- I led the subgroup on Model Development, although I participated actively in the remaining three (Data Management, Model Management, and Model Serving) \\
- A set of recommendations (prioritized and categorized in topics) and tasks to do (internal processes, external relations, tools, etc.) to guarantee that ML/DL practitioners could work with less friction in the new cloud environments. \\
}

\cventry{2021--2022}{\large Principal Research Engineer}{Ads @ Yahoo}{}{Sunnyvale}{}

\cventry{}{\small AI/ML Working Group}{AI/ML future strategy definition in the cloud}{}{\textbf{Roles}: ML/AI Expert, Strategy}{
In the advertising platform, as we were moving toward a cookie-less world, the ability to track users’ online activities for behavior targeting was be drastically reduced, making contextual targeting an appealing alternative for advertising platforms. Using our experience
in hierarchical multilabel classification in other contexts, we helped the Ads team to use it in category-based contextual targeting at
Yahoo. We proposed and implemented a multilingual model that can accurately classify web pages into a hierarchical taxonomy (specifically, the Yahoo Interest Categories taxonomy) without crawling their content.
\textbf{Goal} Transfer the knowledge and experience in taxonomy-based multi-label classification into Ads team and build a platform for training/evaluating the models \\
\textbf{Achievements} \\
- I helped the Ads team to develop a pipeline for training models for the task at hand \\
- \textit{Multilingual taxonomic web page classification for contextual targeting at Yahoo} paper. In the 28th ACM SIGKDD Conference, 2022 \textbf{7 Citations}\newline

}
\cventry{}{\small Science @ CAP}{Scalable Few-shot Classification with Parallel Prefix Conditioning}{2021}{\textbf{Roles}: ML/DL Engineer, 
Research Engineer}{
\textbf{Goal} Modify a transformer architecture (e.g. BERT) to achieve fast and effective \\
few-shot classification by prefixing multiple category labels to the input. \\
\textbf{Method} Class representations are encoded in parallel but produce independent binary \\
labels for each input through a shared classification output layer. \\
\textbf{Achievements}
- Experiments on the DBPedia dataset demonstrated improved few-shot performance over standard multi-class classifiers and a speedup over binarized formulations. \\
- Further analysis showed that the approach can scale to a large number of categories and may hold promise for zero-shot learning of unseen categories. \\

\section{Hobbies and Interests}
\cvline{}{\small Beyond my core professional focus, but some way related to it, I have a strong interest in the 
intersection of fields such as neuroscience, psychology, decision-making, cognitive sciences, learning techniques, 
behavioral economics, and philosophy, as they offer valuable insights into human behavior, intelligence, and how 
the brain works (and why!) I am deeply fascinated by the mechanisms of human thought, learning, and behavior, and
how these insights can inform and inspire advancements in AI and our daily lives and wellbeing in general.
}
\cvline{}{\small In my personal life, I enjoy staying active through activities like running, mountain biking, yoga, cold-plunging, 
and playing tennis, which not only keep me physically fit but also provide a sense of balance and focus.
