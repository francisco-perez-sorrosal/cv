\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{2023--Now}{\large Principal Research Engineer}{Knowledge Graph Science @ Yahoo Inc.}{}{Sunnyvale}{}

\cventry{}{\small YKG}{Dataset Quality Improvement}{2024}{\textbf{Roles}: ML/AI Expert}{
\textbf{Goal} Since the labels of most entity pairs were generated in a semi-supervised manner, I developed an LLM-based solution to validate and enhance the labeling accuracy of the dev and test datasets \\
\textbf{Achievement} I implemented a generative Entity Matching solution with Llama 2 to identify and fix (by re-labeling) misclassified examples in the dev/test sets \\
}

\cventry{}{\small YKG}{Entity Reconciliation Model Training}{2023-2024}{\textbf{Roles}: Machine Learning/AI Expert}{
Fine-tuned transformer-based language models (LMs) on heterogeneously labeled datasets, integrating editorially curated data with automatically labeled data through entity linking via common identifiers. This approach aimed to deduplicate and reconcile meta-entities related to People and Creative Works. \\
\textbf{Goal} Improve current production metrics on both categories \\
\textbf{Achievements} \\
- I trained and optimized a unified, type-agnostic LM model for entity matching/reconciliation, replacing tens of type-specific production models and simplifying the maintenance of the reconciliation stage in the Knowledge Graph \\
- Metric improvements: \\
1) Overall increases of 22.23\% and 16.11\% in precision and recall for Person \\
2) Overall increases of 5\% and 4\% in precision and recall for Creative Works \\
- Reduced model size by 33\%, lowering the model's storage requirements and improving efficiency without compromising its entity matching accuracy \\
}

\cventry{}{\small YKG}{Entity Reconciliation Pipeline}{2023}{\textbf{Roles}: Machine Learning/AI Expert, MLOps}{
- Built pipelines for distributed sampling, preprocessing, and transformation of large-scale entity data extracted from various complementary sources that accurately reflect user search behavior. \\
- Developed an automated pipeline for training entity reconciliation models for YK, from data curation to inference testing \\
\textbf{Goal/Achievements} \\
- We devised a solution to reduce the current number of models maintained in production from \~30 heterogeneous (heuristic-based, SVMs, Tree-based...) to just 4, which encompass the main 4 meta-entity types in YK \\
- We expanded entity type coverage to 20 new types of people entities (e.g., directors, producers, composers, writers, politicians\ldots{}) and 32 new types of creative works (e.g., visual works, theatrical works, critic’s reviews, periodicals, poems\ldots{}) \\
}

\cventry{}{\small YKG}{Entity Reconciliation Inference}{2023}{\textbf{Roles}: MLOps}{
\textbf{Goal} Designed and architected a PoC solution for cloud-based inference \\
\textbf{Achievement} I implemented a Ray Serve-based solution to deploy new YK models in the cloud, optimizing for cost efficiency by evaluating CPU and GPU-based approaches \\
}

\cventry{Jun--Dec 2022}{\large Principal Research Engineer}{Yahoo Mail}{}{Sunnyvale}{}

\cventry{}{\small Science @ Mail}{Kamino Project - mail classification system}{}{\textbf{Roles}: Machine Learning/AI Expert}{
\textbf{Goal} Upgraded legacy production models to a new generation of deep learning-based, small distilled models optimized for large-scale deployment. These models were designed to classify incoming mail using a newly developed multilabel taxonomy tailored to the mail team’s specific use cases \\
\textbf{Approach} \\
I developed a deep learning pipeline using Hugging Face to train/evaluate models based on the Teacher/Student knowledge distillation framework. Starting with limited human-labeled training data, a large and complex teacher model was created to achieve high accuracy. This model was then used to generate teacher-labeled data for training lightweight student models optimized for deployment. Two types of student models were produced: (1) online models, optimized for speed and suitable for real-time classification tasks, and (2) offline models, designed to include richer information for improved accuracy in non-real-time applications \\
\textbf{Achievements} \\
The resulting student models for an expanded taxonomy, more than doubling the number of deployable categories in the taxonomy while improving performance on existing categories in production by 3.1-5.9\%

\cventry{Apr--Sep 2022}{\large Principal Research Engineer}{Digital Transformation Office @ Yahoo}{}{Sunnyvale}{}

\cventry{}{\small AI/ML Working Group}{AI/ML future strategy definition in the cloud}{}{\textbf{Roles}: ML/AI Expert, Strategy}{
As Yahoo transitioned its infrastructure from on-premises data centers to a fully cloud-based environment, scientists and research engineers required modern tools to streamline their workflows. These tools needed to facilitate dataset and model sharing, ensure reproducibility of experiments, enable rapid experimentation and iteration on new models, and support seamless publishing and deployment into pre-production/production environments \\
\textbf{Goal} Specifically, the Model Development subgroup was dedicated to establishing the requirements, standards, tools, and frameworks needed to scale ML/DL applications effectively across the company \\
\textbf{Achievements} \\
- I led the discussions on the Model Development subgroup, although I participated actively in the remaining three (Data Management, Model Management, and Model Serving) \\
- We delivered a set of recommendations (prioritized and categorized in topics) and tasks to do (internal processes, external relations, tools\ldots{}) to guarantee that ML/DL practitioners could work with less friction in the new cloud environments \\
}

\cventry{2021--2022}{\large Principal Research Engineer}{Ads @ Yahoo}{}{Sunnyvale}{}

\cventry{}{\small Science @ Ads}{Contextual Targeting Solution}{}{\textbf{Roles}: ML/AI Expert, Strategy}{
In the Ads platform, as we were moving towards a cookie-less world, the ability to track users' online signals for behavioral targeting would be drastically reduced, making contextual targeting an appealing alternative for advertising platforms. Using our experience in hierarchical multilabel classification in other contexts, we helped the Ads team to use it in category-based contextual targeting at Yahoo. We proposed and implemented a multilingual model that can accurately classify web pages into a hierarchical taxonomy (specifically, the Yahoo Interest Categories taxonomy) without crawling their content \\
\textbf{Goal} Transfer the knowledge and experience in taxonomy-based multi-label classification to the Ads team and build a platform for training/evaluating the models \\
\textbf{Achievements} \\
- I helped the Ads team to develop a pipeline for training models for the task at hand \\
- \textit{Multilingual taxonomic web page classification for contextual targeting at Yahoo} paper (ACM SIGKDD 2022) \textbf{7 Citations} \\

- I trained new models obtaining significantly better metrics over the ones in production (+10\% over baseline) \\
- We developed a serving pipeline based on NVIDIA's Triton Server to deploy in production \\
}
\cventry{}{\small Science @ CAP}{Scalable Few-shot Classification with Parallel Prefix Conditioning}{2021}{\textbf{Roles}: ML/DL Engineer, 
Research Engineer}{
\textbf{Goal} Modify a transformer architecture (e.g. BERT) to achieve fast and effective \\
few-shot classification by prefixing multiple category labels to the input. \\
\textbf{Method} Class representations are encoded in parallel but produce independent binary \\
labels for each input through a shared classification output layer. \\
\textbf{Achievements} \\
- I conducted experiments on the DBPedia dataset demonstrated improved few-shot performance over standard multi-class classifiers and a speedup over binarized formulations. \\
- Further analysis showed that the approach could be scaled to a large number of categories and may hold promise for zero-shot learning of unseen categories. \\
}

\section{Hobbies and Interests}
\cvline{}{\small Beyond my core professional focus, but some way related to it, I have a strong interest in the 
intersection of fields such as neuroscience, psychology, decision-making, cognitive sciences, learning techniques, 
behavioral economics, and philosophy, as they offer valuable insights into human behavior, intelligence, and how 
the brain works (and why!) I am deeply fascinated by the mechanisms of human thought, learning, and behavior, and
how these insights can inform and inspire advancements in AI and our daily lives and wellbeing in general.
}
\cvline{}{\small In my personal life, I enjoy staying active through activities like running, mountain biking, yoga, cold-plunging, 
and playing tennis, which not only keep me physically fit but also provide a sense of balance and focus.
