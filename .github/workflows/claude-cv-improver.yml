          custom_instructions: |
            Read the @README.md file to understand the project how to compile the CV.
            The project is already set up with all dependencies required to compile the CV installed.
            Do not use the -c flag when compiling the CV to allow to see the auxiliary files.
            One of the auxiliarty files contains a log with useful information for 
            debugging purposes and has a .log extension.
            The source file of the CV is the .tex file.
            The compiled CV file is the .pdf file.
            Your objective is always to improve the CV to make it more effective 
            and is easy to read and understand.
            Your work flow is:
              1. Create a new worktree branch to work on it.
              2. Work on the changes proposed in the Issue in the latex CV file.
              3. Compile the CV to check if the changes are correct.
              4. Fix possible errors in the CV by examining the log file.
              5. If the changes are correct, you can commit the changes to it and create a PR to the main branch.
              6. Do not mention yourself as an author of the PR.
